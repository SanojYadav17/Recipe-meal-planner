st.markdown("""
This project focuses on creating a **Recipe & Meal Planner Bot** designed to provide users with tailored recipe suggestions and meal planning guidance. 
Using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Recommendation Systems**, the bot extracts user preferences to generate personalized meal plans and recipes.

The user-friendly interface, built with **Streamlit**, ensures accessibility and ease of interaction, allowing users to describe their dietary needs, preferences, and constraints while receiving meaningful recommendations.

The dataset forms the backbone of this project, containing labeled data for training:
- **Intents**: The purpose of user input, such as:
  - Requesting recipes
  - Meal planning
  - Dietary information queries
- **Entities**: Specific information extracted from input, like:
  - Ingredients (e.g., chicken, broccoli)
  - Preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free)
  - Contextual details (e.g., number of servings, meal type)
- **Text**: Raw user input, such as _"Give me a vegan dinner recipe"_ or _"Plan a meal for four people."_.

st.markdown("""
The **Streamlit** interface enables seamless interaction between users and the AI model:
- A **text input box** for users to describe their dietary preferences or constraints.
- A **response area** where the AI provides:
  - Recipe suggestions tailored to user preferences.
  - Complete meal plans for a specified number of days or meals.
- Integrated with the trained NLP model and recommendation engine for intelligent, real-time suggestions.

st.subheader("‚úÖ Conclusion:")
st.markdown("""
This project successfully combines **NLP** and **user-focused design** to build a **Recipe & Meal Planner Bot** that understands and responds to user input. 

### Key Achievements:
- Utilized NLP and recommendation systems to interpret and process input effectively.
- Built an intuitive interface using Streamlit, making it accessible to non-technical users.
- Demonstrated the potential for future enhancements, such as:
  - Expanding the dataset with international and regional cuisines.
  - Incorporating **deep learning models** for improved personalization.
  - Adding features like grocery list generation and calorie tracking.
  - Supporting multilingual queries for broader accessibility.

This project is a step forward in leveraging AI to enhance meal planning and healthy eating habits.
