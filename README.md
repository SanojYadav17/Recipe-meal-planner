Here's a README section for your project titled **Recipe Meal Planner using NLP**:
# Recipe Meal Planner 



## Overview

The **Recipe Meal Planner** is an intelligent application designed to assist users in identifying potential health conditions based on their reported symptoms. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this tool analyzes user input and matches it against a comprehensive dataset of symptoms and associated conditions. The goal is to provide users with informative responses and guidance on when to seek medical attention.

## Features

_ **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.
_ **NLP Integration**: Leverages NLP algorithms to understand and process user input effectively.
_ **Extensive Recipe Dataset**: Contains a wide range of recipes and meal types, ensuring accurate matching.
_ **Response Generation**: Provides step-by-step instructions and ingredient lists for recipes.
_ **Continuous Learning**: The dataset can be updated and expanded to include new recipes, cuisines, and ingredients.


## Dataset


The application uses a JSON dataset (recipes.json) that includes:

_ **Tags**: Unique identifiers for each recipe or meal type.
_ **Patterns**: Common phrases and ingredients that users might input.
_ **Responses**: Informative messages with recipe suggestions and preparation instructions.
